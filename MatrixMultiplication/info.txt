1. generate the data set from python script
   python3 generate_matrix.py 800 mat800 800 x 800 matrix is generated for both A and B

2. compile the openmp and mpi programs
   g++ mm_openmp.cpp -fopenmp -O2 -o mm_openmp
   mpic++ mm_mpi.cpp -O2 -o mm_mpi

3. chmod +x run_mm.sh
   run bash automation script which runs this code on on variable number 
   of threads and preocessors respectively
   ./run_mm.sh

4. produces necessary graphs of the output of both the programs
   python3 plot_mm.py
